# I-94 Westbound Traffic Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze a dataset that contains information about the westbound traffic on the I-94 Interstate highway. The objective of this analysis is to identify various indicators of heavy traffic on I-94, such as weather conditions, time of the day, day of the week, and other factors that might contribute to heavy traffic.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is available in a CSV file format and was obtained from kaggle. The dataset contains various features such as date, time, temperature, weather conditions, traffic volume, etc.

## Methodology

The project involved several steps, including data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and presenting the findings and recommendations.

During the data cleaning and preprocessing stage, we removed duplicates, missing values, and outliers in the dataset to ensure it was ready for analysis. We then conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the characteristics and features of the dataset. We used various data visualization techniques to present the results, such as line charts, bar charts, and scatter plots.

## Results

Based on our analysis, we discovered that traffic volume tends to be highest during rush hour periods, especially during the morning and evening commutes. We also found that weather conditions such as precipitation, temperature, and wind speed can have a significant impact on traffic volume. In addition, we observed that traffic tends to be lighter on weekends and holidays compared to weekdays.

## Conclusion

The findings from this project provide valuable insights that can be used to optimize transportation systems and better manage traffic flow on I-94. For example, our analysis suggests the need to improve public transportation options during rush hour periods or implement road weather information systems to help drivers plan their commutes based on weather conditions.
